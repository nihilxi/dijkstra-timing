# Dijkstra's Algorithm Time Measuring Program

## Description

This program measures the execution time of Dijkstra's algorithm, which is used to find the shortest path in a graph with non-negative weights. The program is implemented in C++ and consists of the following features:

1. **Loading a graph from a file**
2. **Graph generation**
3. **Graph display (matrix/list)**

## Usage

The text file to be loaded must have the following format:

{Number of nodes} {Number of edges}\
{Start node} {End node} {Weight}\
{Start node} {End node} {Weight}\
{Start node} {End node} {Weight}\
...
